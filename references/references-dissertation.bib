Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on 
	neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark,
	CKM quark-mixing matrix,  Vud &  Vus,  Vcb &  Vub, 
	fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles,
	cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology.
	
	A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full  Review. All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website:  pdg.lbl.gov.}

Low-energy electron scattering from nuclei is described with reference to the manner in which it reveals the presence of protons in the nucleus; high-energy electron-proton interactions are then discussed and the presence of partons in the proton revealed by analogy. Then the basic ideas of the parton model are described and the evidence that partons are, in fact, quarks and electrically neutral gluons is discussed. The model is then applied to a variety of processes and is shown to correlate an enormous amount of data. Recent clues that the quark parton model is an approximation to a more fundamental theory are described, with particular reference to the possibility that quarks and gluons are the quanta of a field theory of strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics) analogous to the role that electrons and photons play in QED.}

The data confirm that the structure functions of the nucleon measured in nuclei are different from those measured on quasi-free nucleons in deuterium. The kinematic range of the data is such that 〈Q2〉 ∼ 5 GeV2 at x ∼ 0.03, increasing to 〈Q2〉 ∼ 35 GeV2 for x ∼ 0.65. The measured cross section ratios are less than unity for x ≲ 0.05 and for 0.25 ≲ x < 0.7. The decrease of the ratio below unity for low x becomes larger as A increases as might be expected from nuclear shadowing. However, this occurs at relatively large values of Q2 (∼ 5 GeV2) indicating that such shadowing is of patrionic origin."

The measured structure function ratios have small statistical and systematic errors, particularly at small and intermediate x. The observed Q2 dependence in the range x = 0.1−0.4 is stronger than predicted by perturbative QCD. From the present data together with results from other experiments it is suggested that the twist-four coefficient for the proton is smaller than that for the neutron for x larger than 0.2."

	abstract = {Abstract The Jefferson Laboratory's superconducting radiofrequency (srf) Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) provides multi-GeV continuous-wave (cw) beams for experiments at the nuclear and particle physics interface. CEBAF comprises two antiparallel linacs linked by nine recirculation beam lines for up to five passes. By the early 1990s, accelerator installation was proceeding in parallel with commissioning. By the mid-1990s, CEBAF was providing simultaneous beams at different but correlated energies up to 4 GeV to three experimental halls. By 2000, with srf development having raised the average cavity gradient to 7.5 MV/m, energies up to nearly 6 GeV were routine, at 1–150 μA for two halls and 1–100 nA for the other. Also routine are beams of >75\% polarization. Physics results have led to new questions about the quark structure of nuclei, and therefore to user demand for a planned 12 GeV upgrade. CEBAF's enabling srf technology is also being applied in other projects. }

	abstractNote = {A new model of the higher symmetry of elementary particles is introduced ln which the eight known baryons are treated as a supermultiplet, degenerate in the limit of unitary symmetry but split into isotopic spin multiplets by a symmetry-breaking term. The symmetry violation is sscribed phenomenologically to the mass differences. The baryons correspond to an eight-dimensional irreducible representation of the unitary group. The pion and K meson fit into a similar set of eight particles along with a predicted pseudoscalar meson X/sup o/ having I = 0. A ninth vector meson coupled to the baryon current can be accomodated natarally in the scheme. It is predicted that the eight baryons should all have the same spin and parity and that pseudoscalar and vector mesons should form octets with possible additional singlets. The mathematics of the unitary group is described by considering three fictitious leptons, nu , e/sup -/ , and mu /sup -/, which may throw light on the structure of weak interactions. (D. L.C.)},

These counters are intended to separate electrons/positrons from other particles up to 4 GeVc. The counters are operated at atmospheric pressure with CO2. Each counter is equipped with ten mirrors. Light weight, thin spherical mirrors (∼ 5.5 × 10−3 radiation lengths) have been employed resulting in a total thickness of ∼ 1.4 × 10−2 radiation lengths crossed by the particles. A prototype of the counter has been tested at CERN with a mixed beam of positrons, pions and protons from 1 to 4 GeVc. Its detection efficiency for positrons and the rejection ratios for pions and protons have been measured as a function of the pulse height response (or equivalently the number of photoelectrons). An improvement of 34% in the number of photoelectrons has been obtained by using a wavelength shifter coated on the photocathode glass window. With such an improvement in 1 m long radiator, an inefficiency for positrons less than 10−3 and rejection ratios πe at the level of few 10−3 and pe smaller than 10−3 have been obtained for pulse heights above 2 photoelectrons. Contaminations of particles below the Cherenkov threshold is fully understood considering δ-rays production."

The Drell-Yan cross sections for lepton pair production in proton-platinum at 440 GeVc-1 and pion-tungsten at pion energy 280 GeV interactions were calculated in addition to the prediction of the behaviour of cross-section ratios in different kinematical regions. The predictions show significant nuclear effects in these processes.}

This system was initially developed to complete the MARATHON experiment which required, among other species, tritium as a target material. Thus far, the cells have been loaded with the gas species 3H, 3He, 2H, 1H and 40Ar and operated in nominal beam currents of up to 22.5 μA in Jefferson Lab’s Hall A. While the gas density of the cells at the time of loading is known, the density of each gas varies uniquely when heated by the electron beam. To extract experimental cross sections using these cells, density dependence on beam current of each target fluid must be determined. In this study, data from measurements with several beam currents within the range of 2.5 to 22.5 μA on each target fluid are presented. Additionally, expressions for the beam current dependent fluid density of each target are developed."
