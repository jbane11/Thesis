Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on 
	neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark,
	CKM quark-mixing matrix,  Vud &  Vus,  Vcb &  Vub, 
	fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles,
	cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology.
	
	A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full  Review. All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website:  pdg.lbl.gov.}

	abstract = {Abstract The Jefferson Laboratory's superconducting radiofrequency (srf) Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) provides multi-GeV continuous-wave (cw) beams for experiments at the nuclear and particle physics interface. CEBAF comprises two antiparallel linacs linked by nine recirculation beam lines for up to five passes. By the early 1990s, accelerator installation was proceeding in parallel with commissioning. By the mid-1990s, CEBAF was providing simultaneous beams at different but correlated energies up to 4 GeV to three experimental halls. By 2000, with srf development having raised the average cavity gradient to 7.5 MV/m, energies up to nearly 6 GeV were routine, at 1–150 μA for two halls and 1–100 nA for the other. Also routine are beams of >75\% polarization. Physics results have led to new questions about the quark structure of nuclei, and therefore to user demand for a planned 12 GeV upgrade. CEBAF's enabling srf technology is also being applied in other projects. }

	abstract = "Two threshold gas Cherenkov counters have been constructed for the electron and hadron High Resolution Spectrometers (HRS) of the Jefferson Lab Experimental Hall-A. These counters are intended to separate electrons/positrons from other particles up to 4 GeVc. The counters are operated at atmospheric pressure with CO2. Each counter is equipped with ten mirrors. Light weight, thin spherical mirrors (∼ 5.5 × 10−3 radiation lengths) have been employed resulting in a total thickness of ∼ 1.4 × 10−2 radiation lengths crossed by the particles. A prototype of the counter has been tested at CERN with a mixed beam of positrons, pions and protons from 1 to 4 GeVc. Its detection efficiency for positrons and the rejection ratios for pions and protons have been measured as a function of the pulse height response (or equivalently the number of photoelectrons). An improvement of 34% in the number of photoelectrons has been obtained by using a wavelength shifter coated on the photocathode glass window. With such an improvement in 1 m long radiator, an inefficiency for positrons less than 10−3 and rejection ratios πe at the level of few 10−3 and pe smaller than 10−3 have been obtained for pulse heights above 2 photoelectrons. Contaminations of particles below the Cherenkov threshold is fully understood considering δ-rays production."
