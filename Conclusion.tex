\chapter{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}The MARATHON experiment took inclusive DIS data on the special designed sealed tritium cells, filled with tritium, helium, and deuterium at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The unique opportunity provided by access to tritium allowed the MARATHON experiment to be the first to use DIS to study the internal structurer of this radioactive A=3 system. Alongside tritium, DIS data was taken on both helium-3 and deuterium for ratio comparison. The experimental kinematics produces DIS events for $x$ from 0.18 to 0.8, with a Q$^2$ range of 3 to 12 (GeV$^2$) by rotating the electron spectrometer from 17.5 to 36 degrees and using the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility's 10.6 GeV beam. 
\paragraph{}The MARATHON data was used to produce result for the inclusive DIS cross section for these three gas targets. This measurement has provided the first extraction of the DIS cross section for tritium. Using the cross section measurements of the two A=3 mirror nuclei and deuterium, the MARATHON collaboration has calculated the A=3 EMC effect for both helium-3 and tritium. This experiment will provide the first ever results on the EMC effect of tritium and the first on the comparison of the EMC effects of the two A=3 mirror nuclei. The MARATHON EMC effect for helium-3 agrees well with the previous JLab EMC measurement from experiment E03103 J. Seeley and A. Daniels \cite{seeley}. Due to this agreement, my analysis methods for the extraction of the EMC effect for helium-3 are validated and therefor are valid for the extraction the EMC effect for tritium.
\paragraph{}The biggest source of error for the EMC effect are the isoscalar correction and cross section model dependence. The MARATHON's measurement of the $F^n_2/F^p_n$ ratio will help improve the errors associated with the isoscalar correction once the MARATHON collaboration finishes the analysis. The $F^n_2/F^p_n$ produced by a ratio of tritium and helium-3 will greatly reduce the error of the structure function ratio at high values of $x$ due the small differences in nuclear effects in comparing the two A=3 mirror systems. 


\paragraph{}The aim of this analysis is not to solve the EMC puzzle but too help find one piece of the puzzle. The A=3 EMC effect has been study for the helium-3 system previously. However, the tritium system with one proton and two neutrons has not been previously measured.
