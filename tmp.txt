 \subsubsection{Luminosity Error}
 \paragraph{}The errors involved in the luminosity calculated is the target density thickness measurement, beam charge calculation, and density correction. The error in the target thickness measurement is considered a overall normalization uncertainty. The error for the three gas targets' thickness measurements are: tritium= 0.97\%, helium-3 = 1.12\%, and deuterium = 0.56\% \cite{HATT_eng}. The measurement uncertainties for each gas target are displayed in table \ref{tgt_table}. The amount of beam charge deposited on the target is calculated via the BCM(beam charge monitors) and their calibrations. The BCM calibrations were determined a few times through the run period with no change to the calibration constants. Due to the consistency of the BCMs and the high quality calibration the  error estimation for charge calculation is approximately 0.2\%. The error for the density correction is based in the error from the 2nd order polynomial fit. The error is calculated using the same method as the positron background correct, combining the errors for the fit parameters and the covariance terms through the propagation formula \ref{cv_err} using the current dependent correction function, \ref{eq:dc}. The relative error in charge on target and density correction have been added in quadrature to calculate a systematic error for the luminosity calculation. The systematic error for the luminosity and the systematic error for the correct count of electrons are then added in quadrature to calculate and overall normalized yield error.  
 \subsection{Monte Carlo Yield Error}
-\paragraph{}The responsibility of the Monte Carlo is to accurately account for the acceptance of the spectrometers. The uncertainty for thee Monte Carlo yield combines the statical uncertainty of the number of events generated and the reconstruction of the momentum and angle.  The statistical uncertainty is reduced due to the generation of a few million events. The uncertainty in the reconstruction of an event is a mixture of the uncertainties in the beam x and y position, spectrometer offsets, beam energy, optics, and acceptance cuts. The uncertainties for the beam x and y position was controlled by the BPMs and the calibration I completed. The uncertainty for the BPM measurements is 140 $\mu$m. The beam energy measurement is quoted to have an absolute accuracy of 5 x 10$^{-4}$.  The optics are capable of determining the relative in-plane angle with an accuracy of $\pm$ 0.2 mrad, out-of-plane angle with $\pm$ 0.6 mrad in the target coordinates, and momentum reconstruction 2.5x10$^{-4}$\cite{HallA}.  Using equation \ref{scatangle}, I propagated the resolution of target reconstruction variables to determine the relative uncertainty of the scattered angle to be $\approx$ 0.15\%. I have calculated the effect of the accuracy of the optics by comparing the cross section for the nominal values of , beam energy, scattered angle, and momentum, to the cross section of these values shifted by their uncertainties. A summary of the uncertainties used in the uncertainty of optics reconstruction.
